Dependency Game Instructions and Cards for Printing

The repository contains the materials for the Dependency Game, a serious game developed by Dana Pylaeva and Ilja Vishnevski in 2022 and evolved by Ilja Vishnevski up to the current state. 

The repository contains a file with instructions that also includes a score board and two versions of the file containing the front side for each card - one optimised for printing (CYMG) and the other optimised for viewing (RGB). The back side of the card is contained only in CYMG format. 

To create your copy of the game, you will need to print the cards and also obtain a set of 30 dice (5 in 6 different colours, matching the colours of the cards).
